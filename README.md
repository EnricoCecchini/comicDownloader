This is the 1st Version of my Comic Downloader. 

This program uses the Request and OS modules to download images from websites and stores them in a directory

This program works with comics who's URL for each individual page contains the page number at the end, in either /##.jpg or -##.jpg format.

To use, open the comic/manga you wish to download, open the first page and click Open image in new tab after right-clicking with the mouse.
Check that the URL is in one of the 2 formats the program recognizes, and copy & paste it in the running program when prompted. 
Afterwards, Type the name of the comic you wish to download and the amount of pages it has.

The comic will be downloaded automatically into a new folder with the name introduced and the user will be prompted at the end if they wish to download another comic.
